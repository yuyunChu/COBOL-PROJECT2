# COBOL-PROJECT2
This COBOL project is my hands-on practice during my academic pursuit as a sophomore. 
Practice goals: 
read sequential files, processing files, create a table of inventory data, searching a table, 
compute inventory unit price, calculate a total value, auto-generate output files, sorting-records, 
writing records to a sequential file, printing audit counter, closing files, terminating this program.
